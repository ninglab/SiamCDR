Below is a list of models available in this directory and their significance:

- `FusionFewShot_Layers2_Hidden32_DO0-0_AFrelu_LR0-001_DR0-99_DS4096_BYrna`: This model achieves the best performance (precision@k=1) (of all models using the RNA and Drug encoders that perform the best at descriminating by cancer type and MOA, respectively. See their respective readme files), when used as input to a logistic regression model. This model was used to produce input to DNN.

- ` `: This model achieves the best performance (precision@k=1) (of all models using the raw RNA and Drug features), when used as input to a logistic regression model. This model was used to produce input to DNN.

- ` `: This model achieves the best performance (precision@k=1) (of all models using the encoded RNA and Drug features), when used as input to a logistic regression model. This model was used to produce input to DNN.
