Below is a list of models available in this directory and their significance:

- `Fused-FewShotCDR_NL64_16_DO0-1_AFsigmoid_LR0-01_DR0-99_DS500`: This model achieves the best performance (precision@k=1) (using the best fusion model that fuses the RNA and Drug encoders that perform the best at descriminating by cancer type and MOA, respectively. See their respective readme files).
